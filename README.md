## About ##

This project was inspired by [redditp](https://www.redditp.com/ "redditp.com"). I wanted to have support for image galleries and Flickr photo pages and experiment with a minimal UI. From a technical standpoint, I wanted practice using CommonJS modules for structuring my JavaScript, as well as [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for bundling static assets.
